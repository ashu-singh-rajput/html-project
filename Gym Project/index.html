            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Food and drinks can be categorized as high, medium and low in copper content. Remember that eating a large amount of a low copper food could quickly add up and become a higher dose of copper.

                Therefore, balancing the diet with a variety of nutritious foods will be important.
                
                The general limit for copper is about 1mg per day however, as mentioned earlier, this limit can be more lenient with time based on symptoms and disease management.
                
                We encourage each individual to work one-on-one with a registered dietitian to understand the right balance of copper for them. For most individuals, it is best to make “low” copper foods the base of their diet. There are many nutritious foods in the “moderate” column, so continue to choose moderate copper foods every day, while remaining aware of the listed portion sizes. As for “high” copper foods, choose them infrequently, especially those that are starred* below as being very high copper.
                
                Unfortunately, copper isn t listed on a nutrition facts label so it can be difficult to assess how much copper you are consuming. Here is a helpful list showing foods that are low, medium and high in copper:</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Bodybuilding is quite the feat. It’s not a part time hobby or something to dip in and out of. All professional body builders will know that embarking on this journey takes dedication, hard work, commitment, and huge sacrifice.

                The word bodybuilding is pretty ambiguous. By definition, it means the process of building muscle. Which lots of us try and do in the gym. But in application, it refers to the competitive, bulk and cut, full time job type of bodybuilding.
                
                Either way, lifting the weights it takes to body build takes both physical strength and mental strength.
                
                Sometimes, we need a bit of motivation. A pep talk. Some encouraging words. So, even though it’s cheesy and even though it can can trigger an eye roll, motivational quotes and inspirational quotes can be just the thing we need to spark determination and push ourselves further in training.
                
                Often holding pearls of wisdom and advice to train by, these quotes can be the key to success. So forget their cheesy nature. Write them on the mirror. Engrave them on a water bottle. Say them on entering the gym.</p>
